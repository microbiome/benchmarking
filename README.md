## Miaverse Performance

Tree summarized experiment objects (tse) and phyloseq (pseq) objects can be viewed as two distinct containers with the same content organized in two different ways. Consequently, these two classes of objects do not perform equally when subject to analogous computational tasks. While the time execution might not diverge significantly in the case of smaller data sets, it could be of matter for larger data sets.
