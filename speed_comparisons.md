# Computational efficiency of TreeSE methods

This document provides some benchmarking results comparing the
computational efficiency in standard operations between
`TreeSummarizedExperiment` (tse) and `phyloseq` (pseq) containers for
microbiome data.

## Introduction

To estimate the time efficiency of homologous tasks but with different
data structures (`tse` or `pseq`), we have benchmarked a set of standard
data manipulation routines on data sets of varying numbers of samples
and features, as reported below.

## Data sets

The comparisons are based on publicly available data sets from the
curatedMetagenomicData project. See the homepage for the details and
references.

    # Working variables are assigned with a placeholder to work with them inside the next for loop.
    data_sets <- c("AsnicarF_2017", "GlobalPatterns", "VincentC_2016", "BackhedF_2015", "SilvermanAGutData", "ZeeviD_2015", "SongQAData", "SprockettTHData", "GrieneisenTSData")

    set.seed(3)
    sample_size <- 10

    len_set <- length(data_sets)
    tse <- TreeSummarizedExperiment()
    tmp <- list()

Execution times for different experiments, data sets and containers are
evaluated with a recursive approach. Results are stored into `df`.
